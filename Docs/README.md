# Guardian

Guardian is a Discord bot designed to help moderate and manage your server. With features like automatic role assignment, message logging, and much more. Guardian is the perfect addition to any server.

## Usage

Once Guardian is in your server, you can use the following commands:

- `/help` - Displays a list of available commands
- `/logging setup` - Toggles message logging on or off.
- `/addrole` - Assigns a role to a user.

There are much more commands! Just do "/help"!

## Customization

Guardian is highly customizable and can be configured to fit your server's needs. To customize Guardian, simply edit the `example.env` file by renaming it to `.env`, then editing the variables inside of the file and then restart the bot.
